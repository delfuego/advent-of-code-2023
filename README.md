# Advent of Code 2023

This is the Javascript code I've written for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com). There are zero promises that it's *correct*, much less that it's pretty or efficient; most of it is written in the moments of time I find between tasks, while parenting, or otherwise not entirely devoted to the ideal attention it would merit.
