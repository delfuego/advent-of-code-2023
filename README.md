# Advent of Code 2023

This is the Javascript code I've written for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com). There are zero promises that it's *correct*, much less that it's pretty or efficient; most of it is written in the moments of time I find between tasks, while parenting, or otherwise not entirely devoted to the ideal attention it would merit.

I've decided to use Javascript, since it's the most readily-available language for me to putter in across all the devices and environments I might find accessible in all the above-mentioned moments of time.

Otherwise, I'm 100% sure that there will be easier/better/faster/less-convoluted ways to achieve any of the AoC tasks; so be it.
